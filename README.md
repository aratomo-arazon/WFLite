## Why workflow?

As the scale of the program grows larger, the overall flow of the program becomes more difficult to understand. Parallel processing and asynchronous processing also reduce readability.
The workflow can improve readability and reusability by separating the overall flow and processing details and by hiding concurrency and asynchronicity behind. 

## Description

WFLite can construct a workflow with just four elements. They are <i>Variable</i>, <i>Converter</i>, <i>Condition</i> and <i>Activity</i>.

* [Variable](https://github.com/aratomo-arazon/WFLite/tree/master/doc/Variable.md)
